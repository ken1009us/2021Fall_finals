# Data analysis of Bike Sharing - Big Data Systems dev & impl

## Introduction

Bike sharing has become more popular in recent days. It not only serves as a new way to transit, but also a hobby for many people who prefer a more convenient way to ride.

The dataset includes the data of stations, trips, and weather in 3 cities: Montreal, Toronto, and Washington DC.

Our goal is to improve one data analysis of bike sharing on kaggle and to explore more details by adding two hypotheses in this project to make it more comprehensive.
